A set of tests follows that will test every transition in the explored model at least 1 time.
This will be considered to be a complete test.
The tests are generated by making individual tests that will focus on one transition at a time.
To test a transition, a procedure is written to get to the inital state of the transition, and then the transition itself is performed.
If a transition has already been tested by a previous test it's individual test is skipped.
This creates a lot of tests, but does garantee every transition is tested at least 1 time.
